# SCOTUS-Search-Engine

This is a project I completed as part of a course on data structures.
Given a corpus of SCOTUS documents as .json files, this program indexes the data, storing references in an AVL tree or hash table.
The index is searchable through a command line based UI, using basic boolean queries (AND, OR, NOT operations on individual words)
